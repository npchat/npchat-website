Website for Nicole Schafer Photo & Film.

Built with Hugo & netlifycms.

CMS access is authenticated using GitHub and a Cloudflare Worker.

## Getting Started

### Hosting
I am using Cloudflare Pages, but you can also use Netlify, Render, or any other service for hosting static sites.
A commit on master will trigger a build & deployment.

## Local Development

Clone this repository, and run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Then start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`.
